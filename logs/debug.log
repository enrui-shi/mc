A new scepter dropped by the Lich that summons five (5) shields around you that each block a hit.\n      ? Progression advancements each grant three (3) shields that don't decay over time.\n ?

Precipitate appears on Naga Scale materials, it lets you use the tool quicker with the lesser health on your Player.\n           ? Synergy appears on Steeleaf materials, it will passively repair the tool if you have Steeleaf in your hotbar. The more Steeleaves you have in the hotbar, the faster it repairs.\n           ? Stalwart appears on Knightmetal materials, it will make you more resilient in combat.\n           ? Veiled appears on Raven's Feather materials, it will render arrows invisible.\n ?
